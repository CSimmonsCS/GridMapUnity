# GridMapUnity
This project uses C# and Unity to build a custom grid map that is different than the Unity tile map.  This due to the ability for the grid map to contain multiple different data types (bool, int, float, etc) for more applications that are not just building levels.  Applications, such as, a heatmap, pathfinding, minesweeper &amp; more!
